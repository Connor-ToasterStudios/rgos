- Description

RGOS is my passion project that I have been developing over the past couple of years. I originally was developing this for fun when I was a freshman in high school, but after a couple of months I realized that the AP Computer Science class that I would be taking the next year had a final project. I wanted to blow away the entire class with a really good project, so I made RGOS.

- Design

- Features

- Future Additions

I am planning on developing 3d support in the near future

#Needs Fix:
Half the desktop apps refuse to open unless clicked on through another app.
OS will crash if the fill tool is used to fill an incomplete shape or anywhere on a blank canvas.
Graphics drivers are very broken, and I need to develop device-specific drivers in the future.

#REMEMBER

I constantly forget the dependencies required for this project. Dependencies are listed here:

- gnu-efi

- add rest later...
